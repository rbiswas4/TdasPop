    alpha is assumed to be provided in units of numbers/rest frame year/ comoving Mpc^3
    * (h/0.7)**3

    This is instantiated by the following
    parameters and has the attributes and methods listed


    Parameters
    ----------
    rng : `np.random.RandomState`
        random state needed for generation
    cosmo : `astropy.cosmology` instance, defaults to Planck15
        Cosmology used in the calculation of volumes etc. 
    alpha_rate :`np.float` defaults to 2.6e-5 /yr/Mpc^3 (h/0.7)**3
        rate of supernovae 
    beta_rate : `np.float` defaults to 1.5
    zbin_edges : sequence of floats, defaults to `None`
        Available method of having non-uniform redshift bins by specifying
        the edgees of the bins. To specify `n` bins, this sequence must have a
        length of `n + 1`. Has higher preference compared to setting values for
        `zlower`, `zhigher` and `numBins` which necessarily require uniformly
        spaced bin, and must be set to `None` for other methods to be used.
    zlower : `np.float`, defaults to 1.0e-8 
        Lower end of the redshift distribution, which is used in one of the
        available methods to set the redshift bins. Must be used in concert
        with `zhigher`, and `numBins` with `zbin_edges` set to `None` for this
        to work.
    zhigher : `np.float`, defaults to 1.4,
        Higher end of the redshift distribution, which is used in one of the
        available methods to set the redshift bins. Must be used in concert
        with `zlower`, and `numBins` with `zbin_edges` set to `None` for this
        to work.
    num_bins : `int`, defaults to 28,
        number of bins, assuming uniform redshift bins as one of the variables
        for use in setting the redshift bins. Must be used in concert
        with `zlower`, and `zhigher` with `zbin_edges` set to `None` for this
        to work.
    survey_duration :`np.float`, unit of years, defaults to 10.0
        number of years of survey
    sky_area : `np.float`, unit of sq deg,  defaults to 10.0 
        Used if `skyFraction` is set to `None`. The area of the sky over which
        the samples are calculated. Exactly one of `sky_area` and `skyFraction`
        must be provided.
    sky_fraction : `np.float`, defaults to `None`
        if not `None` the fraction of the sky over which samples are studied.
        if `None`, this is set by `sky_area`. Exactly one of `sky_area` and
        `skyFraction` must be provided.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - rate: The variable rate is a single power law with numerical
        coefficients (alpha, beta)  passed into the instantiation. The rate is
        the number of TDAs at redshift z per comoving volume per unit
        observer time over the entire sky expressed in units of 
        numbers/Mpc^3/year 
    - A binning in redshift is used to perform the calculation of the expected
        number of variables.
    - It is assumed that the change of rates and volume within a redshift bin
        is negligible enough that samples to the true distribution may be drawn
        by obtaining number of variable samples of z from a uniform distribution
        within the z bin.
    - The expected number of variables in each of these redshift bins is
        computed using the rate above at the midpoint of the redshift bin, using
        a cosmology to compute the comoving volume for the redshift bin
    - The actual numbers of variables are determined by a Poisson Distribution
        using the expected number of variables in each redshift bin,
        determined with a random state passed in as an argument.
        This number must be integral.
